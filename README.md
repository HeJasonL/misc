# Misc

A repository for miscellaneous code. Some contents will be experiments, some will be code meant for other people, or to support Twitter threads etc.

## Contents

- `psychometric_func_param_estimation/psychometric_function_grid_approx.ipynb` - An example of how to do Bayesian parameter estimation for a psychometric function model. This uses grid approximation for simplicity. Based on twitter conversation here https://twitter.com/inferencelab/status/1272835921717743622?s=20
- `plotting/radial corner histogram plot.ipynb` - plots a scatter plot along with a radial histogram. Useful for visualising proportions. I wanted to do this in order to plot relative risk, ratio of two probabilities.
